            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Sleepy Dragon is a mobile single page app that fetches random stories from an API that can be read.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was part of the Minor Web Design & Development at the HvA. During three weeks of the course Web App From Scratch, I have designed and developed a Single Page App(SPA) based on a self-chosen user story. This SPA is based on data fetched from an API.

                The project is written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>User story</h2>

            <p>The user story for this project is as follows:</p>
            <q>"As a parent, I want to find random short stories to entertain my child before bedtime so I don't have to continuously search for new stories."</q>

            <h2>Primary functions</h2>
            <p>
                There are a few primary functions in this app. The user can:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Read a random story</li>
                <li>Like/Save a story</li>
                <li>Read a story that has been saved</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Flowchart</h2>

            <p>
                In order to get the structure and functionality of the app properly set up, I created a flowchart that show the different states and functions that can be used.
            </p>

                <img src="images/sleepydragon/flowchart.jpg" alt="" />
            </picture>

            <h2>Wireframes and design</h2>

            <p>
                I made several wireframes for the app. I wanted to make sure that the app was easy to use and that the user could easily find the functions they wanted to use.
            </p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/jpg" srcset="images/sleepydragon/wireframes.jpg" />
                <img src="images/sleepydragon/wireframes.jpg" alt="" />
            </picture>

            <p>
                I wanted the app to look friendly and child focussed. Even though the app wont specifically be used by children(But their parents), I wanted to make sure that the app would be appealing to them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I made several versions of the app design. It didn't take long for me to figure out which colors I wanted to use but the actual layout and detail of the design took me a bit longer. After showing the iterations to my peers I got some good feedback and was able to improve the design.
            </p>

            <h2>Mascot</h2>

            <p>
                The primary audience of this app is children. To make the app more fun and appealing to children, I have created a mascot for the app. The mascot is a dragon that is called Sleepy and is used in the logo and in the app itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dragon is designed in Photoshop and animated in <a href="https://rive.app/">Rive</a>
            </p>

                    <img src="images/sleepydragon/dragon-1.gif" alt="" />
                </picture>

                    <img src="images/sleepydragon/dragon-2.gif" alt="" />
                </picture>
            </div>

            <h2>Web components</h2>

            <p>
                I discovered that there is a native way to use components in Javascript instead of applying frameworks. This caught my interest and I decided to do more research on it. As it turned out, generally people use webcomponents and then apply bare text as html which sits inside the javascript file like so:
            </p>

<pre>
<code>
const template = document.createElement('template');
template.innerHTML = `
    &lt;style&gt;
        h1 {
        color: red;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
`;
</code>
</pre>

            <p>
                This however, defeated the purpose of using web components for me. I wanted to be able to use seperate HTML and CSS files for my components. I found a way to do this by using the <code>fetch()</code> function to get the HTML and CSS files and then applying them to the component. The code I used to do this is a little complex but comes down this: I create a variable that has the list of html templates that I want to insert. I run a function that fetches these files and create new components for each of them using names that are stated within the html files themselves. I can then append these to the DOM by simply using <code>document.createElement("template-name")</code>. In case there is content that needs to be inserted into the component, I can call these using <code>element.shadowRoot.querySelector( '[slot="slot-name"]');</code> and then insert the content using <code>element.textContent</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm quite happy with what I learned about web components and how I applied them to this project. In practice I probably won't be using them as much as I did in this project, but it was a fun learning experience and gave me more understanding about how frameworks like React and Vue work.

            <h2>Final version</h2>

            <p>
                I'm quite happy with the result of this project. Being able to create a web app from scratch and figure out the basics of Javascript frameworks helped me get a better view on how web development works. I'm also happy with the design of the app. I think it's a good balance between playful and easy to handle. There are some major things I learned which include the use of web components, templates, hashes, routes and modules. I also got some more practice in implementing Rive animations.
